# Cookiecutter Django Boilerplate - Cursor Rules

## Core Principle
This is a TEMPLATE repository. Never hardcode project-specific values. Always use Cookiecutter variables.

## Available Variables
- See @cookiecutter.json file to see what variable are available.

## Rules
- Always Use Variables, even for file names and directories (if they requre project name for example. though this is rarely the case)
- Wrap optional features with `{% if cookiecutter.feature_name == 'y' %}...{% endif %}`
- Don't run any commands unless specifically asked to (especially python, poetry and git commands)
- Don't add new cookiecutter template variables, ask before you think it is a good idea.

## Testing
- Don't write or run test commands, unless specifically asked to.
