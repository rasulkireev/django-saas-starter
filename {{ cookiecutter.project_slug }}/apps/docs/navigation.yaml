# Documentation navigation configuration
#
# Define the order of categories and pages in the sidebar navigation.
# If a category or page is not listed here, it will be added alphabetically
# at the end of the respective section.
#
# Configuration format:
# - Use category directory names as keys (e.g., 'getting-started', not 'Getting Started')
# - List page file names without .md extension (e.g., 'introduction', not 'introduction.md')
# - Order matters: categories and pages appear in the order listed
#
# How it works:
# 1. Categories listed here appear first, in the order specified
# 2. Categories not listed appear after, in alphabetical order
# 3. Within each category, pages listed appear first, in the order specified
# 4. Pages not listed appear after, in alphabetical order
#
# Example:
#   navigation:
#     getting-started:
#       - introduction
#       - quickstart
#     api:
#       - overview
#       - authentication
#
# Result: Getting Started section first, API section second, any other sections alphabetically after

navigation:
  getting-started:
    - introduction
    # Any pages not listed here will appear after these, in alphabetical order

  features:
    - example-feature

  deployment:
    - render-deployment
    - docker-compose-deployment

  # Any categories not listed here will appear after these, in alphabetical order
