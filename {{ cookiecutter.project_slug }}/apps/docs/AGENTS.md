# Documentation Writing Guidelines for AI Agents

## Purpose

These guidelines ensure documentation is user-friendly, clear, and actionable for {{ "{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}" }} users.

## Core Principles

### Write for Users, Not Developers
- Focus on **what users can do** with the feature, not how it's implemented
- Use plain language and avoid technical jargon
- Explain business value before technical details
- Assume users have no prior knowledge of the system

### Structure Content for Scanning
- Start with the most important information
- Use clear headings that describe what users will learn
- Break content into short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use bullet points for lists of features or steps
- Include visual breaks between sections

### Be Action-Oriented
- Start with verbs: "Create", "Configure", "Analyze"
- Provide step-by-step instructions with numbered lists
- Include expected outcomes for each action
- Show what success looks like

## Summary

Write documentation that:
- Helps users accomplish their goals
- Is easy to scan and navigate
- Uses clear, friendly language
- Includes practical examples
- Keeps users informed about next steps

Good documentation turns confused users into confident power users.
