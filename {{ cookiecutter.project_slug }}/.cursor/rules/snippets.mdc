This script will be ran in an ipython shell that is executed like so: `python ./manage.py shell_plus --ipython`, this means:

- Run code linearly, no need to abstract away things needlessly
- Don't run via `if __name__ == ...`. just write normally
- No need for django setup stuff
- I'm going to copy/paste the code into the shell
